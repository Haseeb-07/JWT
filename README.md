Welcome to my project! It's a simple yet powerful web application designed using Tailwind.css to handle user authentication smoothly.
Whether you're just starting out or have some experience in web development, you'll find this project helpful and insightful.

At its heart, my project relies on React, a widely-used JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
I've also incorporated React Router to manage navigation and state, making the application more dynamic and user-friendly.
Additionally, I've integrated useful tools like `react-hot-toast` for displaying notifications and `js-cookie` for handling cookies in the browser.

The main feature of my application is user authentication.
Users can easily sign up for an account by filling out a form with their chosen username, email, and password. Once registered, they can securely log in using their credentials.

To ensure security, I've implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
After a successful login, a JWT token is generated and stored in the browser's cookies.
This token is then used to authenticate and authorize users when they access protected routes within the application.

In this project, I've demonstrated how to conditionally render components based on the user's authentication status. 
If a user isn't authenticated, they're directed to the login form. Once logged in, they gain access to the main features of the application.

My aim with this project is to provide a clear and practical example of user authentication in a React application.
Whether you're looking to learn more about React development or implement authentication in your own projects, I hope you find this project useful and informative. 

Happy coding!
